# PROGRAMMING
Welcome this is your first lessons for programming...
##Classes and methods 
Have a look guys on the code on how they work.
You can create your own project on NetBeans and then copy and paste these files to your project.
You can create different projects as example 1, 2, 3 and 4 but do it the way you think is good for you.

The codes are not similar to the ones I did in zoom meeting,these ones I did before zoom meeting.

Have a great day.
