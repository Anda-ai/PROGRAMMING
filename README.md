# PROGRAMMING
Welcome this is your programming lessons...

#Classes and methods 

Have a look on the example codes to understand how classes and methods work.
You can create your own project on NetBeans and then copy and paste these files to your project.
You can create different projects as example 1, 2, 3 and 4 but do it the way you think is good for you.

The codes are not similar to the ones I did in zoom meeting,these ones I did before zoom meeting.

#Searching and Collections

Please create a dictionary so that a user can search for words, add words and even remove them.

Have a great day.
